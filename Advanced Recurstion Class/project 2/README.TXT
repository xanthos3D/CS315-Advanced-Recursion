with exception to the template provided by Ali Kooshesh all of the
code written in my solutions.hpp and solutions.cpp was only written by me.
i did use part of the code for shallow reverse in my total reverse function,
but i also wrote that with matt who played no part in my modification of the function
into total reverse for this project.

i have not provided any code to any other student. i have discussed different ways of implementation with other students.
i have talked to mark ian and teo about some possible ways of solving these problems but they where more just hints than anything else.

everything except for permute is working as intended with all features listed in reclists.pdf.
